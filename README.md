# whos_home
who's home? An arduino program that queries a Meraki dashboard for a corresponding device (e.g. phone) connected to your wifi and lights up an led if the owner is home. Hardware setup description to come later. 

### Installation & Running
Clone the repo and run `cp secrets_example.h secrets.h`, then fill in the fields.
I wrote this for 4 roommates and 1 access point, so adjust as needed.
